name: n8n-evol-I
description: A harness to help coding agents build, deploy, maintain, and debug multi-workflow n8n-powered automation systems. No lock-in — work from the agent, continue from the n8n UI, hand back to the agent at any time.

# n8n-evol-I skill router

This is the entry point. When the user asks anything n8n-related, route to the matching sub-skill.

## Mental model

- The skill package (this directory) is **read-only**. You never edit files here.
- The user's project state lives in `${PWD}/n8n-evol-I-workspace/` (created by `init.md`).
- Helpers are Python scripts under `helpers/`. Invoke them with `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/helpers/<name>.py [args]` (plugin mode) or `python3 <path-to-harness>/helpers/<name>.py [args]` (skill mode).
- All helpers default to `--workspace ${PWD}/n8n-evol-I-workspace`. Pass `--workspace <path>` if the user runs from elsewhere.
- **Agent memory**: read `N8N-WORKSPACE-MEMORY.md` in the workspace at the start of every session; append a dated entry whenever you learn something durable about this project. Full guidance in `AGENTS.md` (also in the workspace root).

## Lifecycle skills (use when the user wants to do X)

| [tidy-workflow.md](skills/tidy-workflow.md) | Apply n8n's canvas-layout algorithm to a workflow template to clean up node positions. |
| [deploy.md](skills/deploy.md) | Deploy one workflow to one env. |
| [activate-single-workflow-in-env.md](skills/activate-single-workflow-in-env.md) | Activate after deploy. |
| [deactivate-single-workflow-in-env.md](skills/deactivate-single-workflow-in-env.md) | Pause triggers (commonly during dev). |
| [archive-workflow.md](skills/archive-workflow.md) | Retire a deployed workflow (hidden + read-only on the live instance). |
| [unarchive-workflow.md](skills/unarchive-workflow.md) | Restore a previously-archived workflow so it accepts updates again. |
| [deploy_all.md](skills/deploy_all.md) | Roll out an entire env in tier order. |
| [resync.md](skills/resync.md) | Pull live state of one workflow back into its template. |
| [resync_all.md](skills/resync_all.md) | Snapshot a full env back to templates. |
| [dehydrate-workflow.md](skills/dehydrate-workflow.md) | Convert raw exported JSON into a template. |
| [validate.md](skills/validate.md) | Structural REST validation before deploy. |
| [run.md](skills/run.md) | Fire a webhook + assert terminal status. |
| [debug.md](skills/debug.md) | Investigate a failing or missing execution — from vague symptom to root-cause with evidence. |
| [deploy-run-assert.md](skills/deploy-run-assert.md) | One-shot validate → deploy → run verify. |
| [find-skills.md](skills/find-skills.md) | While authoring, find applicable patterns/integrations. |
| [manage-credentials.md](skills/manage-credentials.md) | Create or link n8n credentials (Path A from `.env.<env>` / Path B from existing UI credential). |
| [add-cloud-function.md](skills/add-cloud-function.md) | Scaffold a Python serverless function / cloud function / serverless API under `<workspace>/cloud-functions/`. |
| [iterate-prompt.md](skills/iterate-prompt.md) | Optimize a prompt against a paired schema + dataset using DSPy. |
| [test.md](skills/test.md) | Run unit tests over n8n Code-node JS and / or cloud-function Python. |

## Placeholder syntax (workflow templates)

Templates use `{{@:type:path}}` (preferred form) or the canonical long form `{{INTERPOLATE:type:path}}`. The two are equivalent — `@` is an alias for `INTERPOLATE`. Examples below use the `@` form.

| Type | Syntax | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `env` | `{{@:env:key.path}}` | YAML config value (dot notation) |
| `txt` | `{{@:txt:relative/path.txt}}` | Text file in workspace |
| `json` | `{{@:json:relative/path.json}}` | JSON file (stringified) |
| `html` | `{{@:html:relative/path.html}}` | HTML file |
| `js` | `{{@:js:relative/path.js}}` | JavaScript file |
| `py` | `{{@:py:relative/path.py}}` | Python file (Code-node `language: python`) |
| `uuid` | `{{@:uuid:identifier}}` | Fresh UUID v4 (consistent within one hydration) |
