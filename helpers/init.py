# AGENTS.md — n8n-evol-I workspace orientation

You are a coding agent working in an n8n-evol-I workspace. This file tells you
where things are and how to operate. Read it at the start of every session.

## Skill router

All n8n actions route through `<harness>/SKILL.md`. When the user asks anything
n8n-related, read that file first to find the right sub-skill and helper.

## Session memory

**Read `N8N-WORKSPACE-MEMORY.md` at the start of every session.**
It contains project-specific knowledge accumulated over time: workflows that exist,
env configurations, investigation findings, workspace deviations from the default
tree, credential quirks, recurring failure patterns, and anything else worth
remembering. It saves you context that would otherwise require re-reading multiple
config files and asking the user to re-explain their setup.

**Update `N8N-WORKSPACE-MEMORY.md` whenever you learn something durable.** This is
your responsibility, not the user's. Append a short dated entry any time you:
- Create or significantly understand a workflow (what it does, key inputs/outputs).
- Add or configure a new environment.
- Discover a workspace deviation from the default layout above.
- Complete an investigation and reach a finding worth reusing (root cause, fix applied).
- Encounter a credential or integration quirk specific to this project.
- Learn anything that would save context in the next session.

You do not need to keep entries perfectly formatted. Short, direct notes are better
than no notes. Append; don't rewrite history.

## Notes (static, managed by user)
