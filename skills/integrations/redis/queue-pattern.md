# Redis Streams (queue pattern)

The harness ships four queue primitives backed by **HTTP Request against the Upstash Redis REST API**, NOT the dedicated `n8n-nodes-base.redis@1` node. Redis@1 exposes `delete | get | incr | info | keys | llen | pop | push | publish | set` only — no XADD / XREADGROUP / XACK / XAUTOCLAIM / XPENDING. Streams ops require a different transport.

## Credential

`redis_rest` credential type — `httpHeaderAuth` with header `Authorization: Bearer <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>`. Mint via [`manage-credentials.md`](../../manage-credentials.md) Path A from `.env.<env>`'s `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. The four queue primitives reference it via `{{@:env:credentials.redis_rest.{id,name}}}` placeholders.

The existing `credentials.redis` (TCP redis@1) is left untouched — the lock + rate-limit primitives keep using it.

## Shipped primitives

| Primitive | Trigger | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `queue_publish` | `executeWorkflowTrigger` (passthrough; expects `{stream, payload, max_len?, approximate?}` in `$json`) | `{stream, message_id, published:true}` or thrown error |
| `queue_pop` | `executeWorkflowTrigger` (inputs: `stream, group, consumer, max_concurrency, max_retries, dlq_enabled, batch_size, claim_idle_ms`) | `{empty:true}` / `{at_capacity:true}` / `{dlq_routed:true}` / `{message_id, payload, ..., permit_held:true}` |
| `queue_ack` | `executeWorkflowTrigger` (inputs: `stream, group, message_id, success`) | `{acked:true, idempotent:bool, xacked:bool, success:bool, inflight_count_after}` |
| `error_handler_queue_cleanup` | `errorTrigger` | `{cleaned:bool, cleaned_count, streams:[]}` |

Every Code-node body inside these primitives starts with `// @n8n-evol-I:primitive` to bypass `validate.py`'s pure-function discipline. **Do not copy that marker into user Code nodes** — it silently disables validation.

## `q:*` key namespace

| Key | Shape | Set by | Cleared by | TTL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `q:<stream>:inflight` | integer counter | `queue_pop` INCR Inflight | `queue_ack` DECR Inflight (on success), `queue_pop` DECR Rollback (on over-capacity), `error_handler_queue_cleanup` DECR Inflight (on failed-exec match) | **none** — operational state, must equal permit count |
| `q:<stream>:permits:<message_id>` | JSON sidecar `{message_id, execution_id, sub_execution_id, workflow_id, workflow_name, stream, group, claimed_at}`. `execution_id` is the **caller** (consumer) execution; `sub_execution_id` is the queue_pop sub-workflow execution (diagnostic only). | `queue_pop` SET Permit Sidecar (with `EX 86400`) | `queue_ack` DEL Permit Sidecar, `error_handler_queue_cleanup` DEL Owned Permit | **EX 86400** (24h backstop) |
| `<stream>` (the Stream itself) | Redis Stream | `queue_publish` XADD | `queue_ack` XACK + retention via XADD MAXLEN | controlled by `--max-len` |
| `<stream>-dlq` | Redis Stream | `queue_pop` XADD to DLQ (when enabled + delivery_count > max_retries) | manual operator action (XRANGE / XDEL) | none — DLQ is forensic |

`q:*` colon-separated namespace deliberately distinct from the lock primitive's `n8n-lock-*` and rate-limit's `n8n-ratelimit-*` (hyphen-separated). KEYS scans of either prefix never overlap.

## Why HTTP Request + Upstash REST (not redis@1)

`n8n-nodes-base.redis@1` predates Redis 5+ Streams (XADD et al). Verified via `mcp__n8n-mcp__search_nodes`: the operation discriminator enum is `delete | get | incr | info | keys | llen | pop | push | publish | set`. None of XADD / XACK / XREADGROUP / XAUTOCLAIM / XPENDING.

Upstash REST is the cleanest fit: `POST <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>/` with a JSON command-array body and `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The response shape is `{result: <result>}` on success or `{error: <msg>}` on failure. Uniform across all command types.

We deliberately route the **semaphore** ops (INCR / DECR / GET / SET / DEL) through the same REST endpoint instead of mixing TCP redis@1 + HTTP. Mixing two access paths would (a) require two distinct credentials per env, (b) split atomicity reasoning across two transports, (c) risk cross-transport consistency drift if the credentials ever pointed at different instances. Single transport, single credential, single mental model.

**`delivery_count` source.** Read from Redis directly via `XPENDING <stream> <group> IDLE 0 <id> <id> 1` — Redis tracks the count per PEL entry, so we read the authoritative value rather than infer it. The detailed-form response is `[[id, consumer, idle_ms, delivery_count]]`; we parse `[0][3]`. The XPENDING node fires only when `Has Message? === true`, so the cost is one extra HTTP round-trip per delivered message — paid only when there's actual work to gate on. If XPENDING returns `[]` (rare race: message XACK'd between Merge and the lookup), we default to `delivery_count = 1`.

The `success: false` path leaves the message in the PEL — XAUTOCLAIM will redeliver after `claim_idle_ms`. This is the "soft NACK" path. The hard XACK case (`success: true`) removes the message from the stream.

```

The handler does **not** XACK. The failed run's work was incomplete; we leave the message in the PEL and let the next XAUTOCLAIM cycle redeliver it (subject to `claim_idle_ms`). This is the more conservative choice — XACK'ing here would silently lose work.

`KEYS` is used (not SCAN) because permits-per-failed-exec is small. For larger fan-outs, swap KEYS → SCAN.

## TTL discipline

- `q:<stream>:inflight` — **no TTL.** The counter must match the count of held permits at all times. A TTL that fired mid-flight would let new consumers exceed `max_concurrency`. Maintained by the {INCR, DECR} pair across `queue_pop` (acquire + over-cap rollback), `queue_ack` (ack), and `error_handler_queue_cleanup` (failed-run release).
- `q:<stream>:permits:<id>` — **EX 86400 (24h).** Defensive backstop only. Normal lifecycle DELs in seconds. 24h is long enough that no normal slow consumer ever expires; short enough to cap permanent leak from a totally broken cluster (no acks, no error handler firing).
